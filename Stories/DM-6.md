# DM-6

## Front End

### Magnitude 13

#### Description
Most of what we need is in the User stories for the front end. However we need to make sure that our additional changes do not break existing components in Nuxt/Vue.

#### Value
Note breaking the front end is very important in keeping our timeline on schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria
* Use existing eslint policies in place
* Run existing component tests on components before development begins and as development is in progress
* Before QA testing begins make sure all tests are still passing

#### Notes
Will break out user stories to cover this story better when Product is ready
